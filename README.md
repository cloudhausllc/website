With any luck, this will be the main website for [Cloudhaus](https://cloudhaus.org), a new makerspace based out of Columbus, Ohio.

As of right now the website is pretty bare bones. It currently features: 

* A home page.
* User registration and authentication

With any luck, these will be the next steps: 

* User permissions and/or groups.
* Accounts other than the first one will need to be approved by an admin.
* User profile pages.
* User image gallery (Made at Cloudhaus!)
* Asset inventory (facilities / tools)


Feel free to modify these lists as needed.
