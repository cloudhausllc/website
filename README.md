With any luck, this will be the main website for [Cloudhaus](http://cloudhaus.org), a new makerspace based out of Columbus, Ohio.

As of right now the website is pretty bare bones. It currently features: 

* A home page.
* User registration and authentication

With any luck, these will be the next steps: 

* User permissions and/or groups.
    * Currently just an "Admin" flag on the user record. I'm not sure if more is needed her or not. At the very least, it's a start for simple stuff.
* Accounts other than the first one will need to be approved by an admin.
    * A work in progress. Currently new users will have an "Active" flag set to false. Still need to make it so admins can set this to true.
* User profile pages.
* User image gallery (Made at Cloudhaus!)
* Asset inventory (facilities / tools)


Feel free to modify these lists as needed.
